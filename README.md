## Summary
This repository contains scripts for a front-end only implementation of an Address Book application deployed on the web.  The UX/UI design uses standard features in HTML and CSS with implementations from the Semantic-UI component framework.  Application functionality, such as adding, saving, and removing contacts from the Address Book, is attained with Javascript ES6/ES2015.  The Address Book data is persistent accross browswer sessions with the utilization of 'localStorage'.  This application was tested successfully using Cucumber-JS.
